        description: "In my first year of High School, I decided to try Rugby on whim. Nearly a decade since then, I’m blown away by how big an influence this sport has been in my life. I’ve learned many important lessons about patience, determination, and camaraderie on the pitch. During my time playing in High School, I worked hard to learn the sport, refine my skills, and eventually contribute to a City Championship victory in my final year. I currently play for the Carleton University Men’s Rugby Team where we’ve been successful in obtaining a championship victory in 2019 and a successful playoff campaign in the 2021 season.",

        description: "I’m a big believer that nobody is “self-made”. Whether it be for sports, academics, or my career, I have received more than my fair share of help from experienced mentors. For this reason, I decided to join the Science Student Success Center at Carleton University, where I’ve had the pleasure of mentoring Computer Science students for over a year now. In this role I’ve worked closely with students to help them define their goals and make plans to achieve them. I’ve also had the opportunity of hosting several workshops on industry technologies such as git. Throughout my mentorship I’ve been fortunate to see many of my students succeed which gives me a great sense of pride.",

        description: "Books have always been a big part of my life. Growing up, I had blown through most of Stephen King’s novels along with dozens of other thrillers, fantasy, and science fiction books. While I still read the occasional novel, my attention has shifted to nonfiction recently. In fact, the books you see in the above image are all some of my recent favourites. I found Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens and its companion novel Homo Deus to be particularly eye-opening. I also reccomend Life 3.0 for those interested in the future of AI and its ethical implications.",

        description: "I’m part of a family of full-blown ski-addicts. My dad had me in skis as soon as I took my first steps, so I have countless amazing memories on the slopes. While I mainly ski as a hobby I did compete on my High School Varisty Ski team and won the Most Improved Athlete award in 2015 which was a rewarding experience. I currently have a family trip to B.C. planned where we’ll be skiing at Revelstoke and Kicking Horse (and I'm beyon excited). If you have any cool skiing experiences you want to share, please reach out, I’d love to hear all about it!",
