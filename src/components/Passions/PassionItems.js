        description: "In my first year of High School, I decided to try Rugby on whim. Nearly a decade since then, I’m blown away by how how much this sport means to me - I’ve learned so many important lessons about patience, determination, and camaraderie on the pitch. During my time playing in High School, I worked hard to learn the sport, refine my skills, and eventually contribute to a City Championship victory in my final year. I currently play for the Carleton University Men’s Rugby Team where we've achieved a championship victory in 2019 and a successful playoff campaign in the 2021 season.",

        description: "I’m a big believer that nobody is “self-made”. Whether it be for sports, academics, or my career, I have received more than my fair share of help. For this reason, I joined the Science Student Success Center at Carleton University, where I’ve had the pleasure of mentoring Computer Science students for over a year now. In this role I’ve worked closely with students to help them define their goals and make plans to achieve them. I’ve also had the opportunity to host several workshops on industry technologies such as git. I’ve been fortunate to see many of my students succeed which gives me a great sense of pride.",

        description: "Books have always been a big part of my life. Growing up, I had blown through most of Stephen King’s novels along with dozens of other thrillers, fantasy, and science fiction books. While I still read the occasional novel, my attention has shifted to nonfiction recently. In fact, the books you see in the above image are all some of my recent favourites. I found Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens and its companion novel Homo Deus to be particularly eye-opening. I also reccomend Life 3.0 for those interested in the future of AI and its ethical implications.",

        description: "I’m part of a family of full-blown ski-addicts. My dad had me in skis as soon as I took my first steps, so I have countless amazing memories on the slopes. While I mainly ski as a hobby I did compete on my High School Varisty Ski team and won the Most Improved Athlete award in 2015 which was super rewarding. Currently, I'm beyond excited for a trip I have planned to ski at the legendary Revelstoke and Kicking Horse mountians in BC this winter. If you have any cool skiing experiences you want to share, please reach out, I’d love to hear all about it!",
