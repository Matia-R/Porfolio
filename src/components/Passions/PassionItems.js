        description: "My dad had me in skis as soon as I took my first steps, so I have countless amazing memories on the slopes. While I mainly ski as a hobby I did compete on my High School Varisty Ski team and won the Coach's choice award in 2015 which was super rewarding. In March of 2022, I got to ski at the legendary Revelstoke and Kicking Horse mountians in BC which was unreal and I can't wait to go back. If you have any cool skiing experiences, please reach out, I’d love to hear all about it!",

        description: "Books have always been a big part of my life. Growing up, I had blown through most of Stephen King’s novels along with dozens of other thrillers, fantasy, and science fiction books. While I still read the occasional novel, my attention has shifted to nonfiction recently. In fact, the books you see in the above image are all some of my recent favourites. I found Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens and its companion novel Homo Deus to be particularly eye-opening. I also reccomend Life 3.0 for those interested in the future of AI and its ethical implications.",

        description: "In my first year of High School, I decided to try Rugby on whim. Nearly a decade since then, I’m blown away by how how much this sport means to me - I’ve learned so many important lessons about patience, determination, and camaraderie on the pitch. During my time playing in High School, I worked hard to learn the sport, refine my skills, and eventually contribute to a City Championship victory in my final year. I've also had the chance to play for the Carleton University Men’s Rugby Team where we achieved a championship victory in 2019 and a successful playoff campaign in the 2021 season. The picture is from our Alumni game. We lost be 50.",

        description: "I’m a big believer that nobody is “self-made”. Whether it be for sports, academics, or my career, I have received more than my fair share of help. For this reason, I joined the Science Student Success Center at Carleton University, where I had the pleasure of mentoring Computer Science students for over two years. In this role I was worked closely with students to help them define their goals and make plans to achieve them. I also had the opportunity of hosting several workshops on industry technologies such as git. I’ve been fortunate to see many of my students succeed which gives me a great sense of pride.",
