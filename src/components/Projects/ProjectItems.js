        description: "Advantage Academy is an online tutoring business I co-founded with the goal of providing safe and affordable assistance to high school students during the Covid-19 pandemic. Since our launch in 2020, our client base has quadrupled, and we’ve been fortunate enough to welcome a second and third wave of tutors to our team. In addition to managing the tutoring team of tutors, I’ve leveraged my technical background to build and maintain the Company website as well as devise automated solutions to our billing and payroll process. Going forward we plan to expand the business to reach more high schools across the province and eventually offer services to university students.",

        description: "A blurb about my Portfolio Website, on my Portfolio website. A Computer Science student might call that a bit ‘recursive’. All jokes aside, this project was a lot of fun to make. My biggest takeaway from this experience was getting to learn React and leverage hooks and states for a more dynamic UI. I also found React components to be incredibly useful for UI templating which allowed me to focus on improving my styling skills. I plan to add to this site periodically and take what I’ve learned to help me build web applications with more substantial backends. Please take a look at my code if you’re interested and feel free to leave feedback. I’m always eager to improve my projects and learn from others!",

        description: "Raven Trade is small web application that aims to mimic popular stock brockerage platforms such as Questrade and Wealth Simple with a theme inspired by Carleton University’s mascot, the Raven. I built this app with a good friend of mine, and it was a first experience in the world of web development for both of us. Together, we learned the fundamentals of JavaScript, templating technologies such as PUG and Jade, REST API development, Node.js, and git collaboration. While the app certainly has its shortcomings, it was a great introduction to many critical web technologies and laid the foundation for my experience as an Automation Developer the following summer.",

Our main objective is to develop tools services that help small businesses create more effective Social Media marketing using Machine Learning. Since we started, I’ve contributed by developing our company website as well as researching options for web infrastructure and hosting. In doing so, I’ve educated myself on cloud technologies and obtained an AWS cloud practitioner certificate. We are still in very early stages and do not have a public presence yet, but if you’re interested in the project, please leave me a message and I’d be happy to discuss.",
